Similarly, since f(-1, 0) = 2, the second component corresponds to the second coordinate of the output vector, resulting in 2. Therefore, applying the linear transformation to the point (3, 5), we get 3 times 1 plus 5 times 2, which equals 3+10, or 13, so the answer is 0. The correct answer is choice C. 0."

False, True\n\nExplanation: Statement 1 directly states that if a set A is connected, then its closure (the set of points that can be reached from A) will also be connected. This is true because connected sets cannot contain any isolated points (points that are not part of any other point). Statement 2, however, asserts that every continuous function f : (0, 1) → (0, 1) has a fixed point. This statement does not necessarily imply that the closure of the set A containing the fixed point is connected. It could be possible for a fixed point to lie outside the closure of A, making it disconnected. Therefore, the correct answer is C. False, True."

    "completion": "Answer: A. True, True\n\nJustification: Both statements discuss the existence of a local maximum point of a function. Statement 1 suggests that if f has a local maximum, then its derivative must exist and be zero at that point. This condition is met if the first derivative test (f'(x) exists and equals 0) holds true for every value of x in the domain of f. Statement 2 states that there exist non-constant continuous maps from the real numbers to the rational numbers. This statement implies that a continuous map can take values between two distinct rational numbers, which is not directly related to the concept of a local maximum point. Therefore, both statements are true together, making Option A correct."

The correct answer is C, which is the nonzero real numbers under multiplication. \n\nOption A, the integers under addition, is not a group because addition does not combine two elements to produce another element (like subtraction). Option B, the nonzero integers under multiplication, is also not a group since multiplication does not combine two elements to produce another element (like division).\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is C.

We're told that the total number of subsets (both types) is equal to 14 more than the number of subsets containing exactly 2 elements. Therefore, we can write two equations:\n\n\\[ n_3 + 14 = n_2 \\]\n\nGiven that there are 28 subsets (including both types), let's substitute this value back into one of our original equations to find \\(n_3\\):\n\n\\[ 28 + 14 = n_2 \\]\n\nSolving for \\(n_2\\), we get:\n\n\\[ n_2 = 42 \\]\n\nNow, to find how many subsets of X contain exactly 4 elements, we use the equation:\n\n\\[ n_3 + 14 = 42 \\]\n\nSubstituting \\(n_3 = 42 - 14\\) gives us:\n\n\\[ 42 - 14 = 28 \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **C. 28**."

    "correct_answer": 3,
    "completion": "E. I and III only\n\nAnswer: D. I and III only\n\nExplanation: The given condition states that the determinant of a matrix equals its transpose times the inverse of itself (det(A - λI) = det(A^(1/2))) with λ ∈ R. To determine if A has eigenvalues -3 and 1, we can use the fact that the determinant of a 3×3 matrix is the product of its diagonal entries plus the product of its off-diagonal entries minus the square of the sum of its diagonal entries. For the given condition, the diagonal elements are 1 and -1, so the determinant must be either -1 or 1. Since we know that det(A) = -λ^3 + 3λ^2 + λ - 3, and the determinant of a 3×3 matrix equals its transpose times the inverse of itself, it follows that det(A) = det(A^(1/2)) = (-λ^3 + 3λ^2 + λ - 3)^(-1). Therefore, we can deduce that A has eigenvalues -3 and 1. Hence, the correct answer is D. I and III only."

    "correct_answer": 0,
    "completion": "Answer: C. f has a relative minimum at (0, 0).\n\nExplanation: A relative minimum occurs where the second derivative is negative. However, since there's no second derivative, we can't directly determine if f has a relative minimum at (0, 0). \n\nOption B states that f has all its relative extrema on the parabola x = y^2. This means that f will have a maximum value when y = 0, but it will also have a minimum value when x = 0. Since there's no direct relationship between x and y, we cannot conclude whether f has a relative minimum at (0, 0) based on this statement alone.\n\nOption D suggests f has an absolute minimum at (2/3, 2/3), which does indeed happen when x = 2/3 and y = 2/3. Therefore, option D is correct. Option A and C are incorrect because they suggest f has all of its relative extrema on the line x = y and the parabola x = y^2 respectively, which doesn't hold in this case due to the absence of second derivatives. The correct interpretation is that f has a relative minimum at (0, 0) under certain conditions, but this information isn't provided in the original problem."

Given that f'(3) = 5, we can use the mean value theorem to determine the maximum value of f(0). Let's denote f(0) as y. We know that f'(3) = 5, so by the Mean Value Theorem, there exists some c between 3 and 4 such that f'(c) = (f(3) - f(c))/3 - 1 = 5. Solving for y gives us y = 5*3 + 1 = 16. Therefore, the greatest possible value of f(0) is 16. \n\nHence, the correct answer is choice D. 9."
