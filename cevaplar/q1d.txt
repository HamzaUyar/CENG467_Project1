Q1.d. (5 points) Explain how the structured approach in Q1.b and Q1.c helped you arrive at an 
answer more mechanically, and critically assess whether it made reaching a solution easier. 
Discuss both the advantages and limitations of this approach, reflecting on its effectiveness in 
guiding your reasoning process. Note that there is no right or wrong answer; the goal is to 
thoughtfully evaluate the process. 
 
The structured pipeline forced me to define variables, constants, and constraints before touching algebra. That made the solution mechanical: once a and b were defined and the balance/ capacity rules were written, the equation for a followed almost automatically.
Separating modeling from options prevented “answer-shape” bias. I derived a numerically justified a first, then mapped to a choice, which reduced second‑guessing.
Listing facts (C, p_A, p_B, E) up front minimized bookkeeping errors and made it easy to check units and feasibility (0 ≤ a ≤ C).
The approach was easier in the sense that each step had a clear purpose and a quick correctness check; debugging was also simpler because mistakes were localized (definition vs. rule vs. arithmetic).
Limitations:

Overhead: for an easy mixture problem, writing four formal steps is slower than a quick mental setup.
Fragility: if an early definition (e.g., ethanol fractions) is wrong, the structure carries that error cleanly but relentlessly to the end.
It can suppress useful intuition/shortcuts; sometimes a direct proportionality argument is faster.
Not all problems are crisply formalizable; ambiguous texts may still require judgment beyond the template.
Overall, it did make the solution more systematic and reliable, especially for reproducibility and later auditing. For simple problems, it adds time; for harder or longer problems, the clarity and error control outweigh the overhead.
