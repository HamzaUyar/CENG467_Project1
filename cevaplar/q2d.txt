Results I observed:
temp=0.1 → 22/99 = 22.22% (official), 25/99 = 25.25% (after manual parse).
temp=0.7 → 23/99 = 23.23% (official), 30/99 = 30.30% (after manual parse).
Temperature effect (intuition):
Higher temperature flattens the next‑token distribution, so sampling explores more alternatives instead of sticking to the top‑1 path.
This sometimes escapes a deterministic but wrong reasoning mode and yields better answers.
It also increases verbosity/format drift; I saw more unparsable endings at 0.7 (21 vs 11), which hurts the strict regex metric.
Net take:
With strict parsing, accuracy rises only slightly at 0.7.
With manual recovery of letters, the benefit is clearer, suggesting exploration helped but formatting degraded.
Conclusion:
Temperature trades determinism for diversity. For CoMAT, moderate diversity can improve correctness, but only if the output format remains controlled.
